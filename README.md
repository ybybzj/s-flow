This is a library that mashes up two other libraries [Baobab](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/baobab) and [flyd](https://github.com/paldepind/flyd), and inspired by [Cerebral](https://github.com/christianalfoni/cerebral).
Signals is created and handled by "flyd", and central state is managed by "Baobab" with reference function I add.
